									<p id="chang" class="collapse">&ldquo;I had the opportunity to work with Walter, and he has shown himself to be a very capable man of action. During my training, Walter has always been very clear about the topics at hand. He was never hesitant to repeat or clarify the subject matter to remove any misunderstanding or confusion. To aid in his communication, he also speaks in an understanding, unthreatening tone that allows learning and productivity to take place. Walter is also a fantastic listener. He is open to new ideas and considers the pros and cons before deciding on a plan of action. While brainstorming with others, he methodically provides constructive ideas that can be built upon and used to derive a solid long-term solution. Walter has displayed great interest and much initiative in taking up new projects that betters the efficiency and up-time of systems and improves the smoothness and completeness of processes. He has shown no fear when taking up new projects, and great determination to see them completed. In addition to these qualities, one thing that sets Walter apart from the rest is that he makes an outstanding team leader because he is considerate of each team member and always takes every opportunity to learn and apply what he has learned. As a leader he has demonstrated his ability to build a team and allow the team to make decisions and function in unity. Over the course of the 6 months I’ve worked with Walter, he has proved to be extremely hardworking, very helpful to me and the rest of the team, and a great benefit to the company and business.&rdquo;</li>

I asked if he could join us at this high powered meeting and asked if he would join us and with the tech talk better explain or decipher what he feels needs to be done. After all of us meeting for over two hours and him sitting while listening we turned and asked him for his thoughts. He calmly sat forward and paraphrasing all the challenges said so your trying to accomplish is X if you could right and the team said yes exactly! He flipped his laptop around and said you mean like this and what the team couldn't solve in over a year and Millions of dollars he corrected overnight based on my nutshell explanation.

				                	<p id="morad" class="collapse">&ldquo;I have known Walter for several years (more than 4). His work ethic is excellent and in all my interactions, he demonstrated excellent attention to detail as well as a deep understanding of the technical discipline he was working with. His strengths are in Quality Assurance and Testing scenario creation. Walter is the closest thing I have seen to a human automaton. He is capable of taking on any problem, distilling it down to the core components, and organizing a team to solve and deliver a solution. In addition he has excellent facilitation skills - specially when working with a team of talented technologists. Walter’s most recent working experience (I directly observed) dealt with organizing the technical implementation of SEC SAS-70 compliant software migration procedures. In this role, Walter lead and empowered a panel of technical and procedural/compliance experts with the primary goal of creating a complete software migration and release process with specific controls to meet the more stringent audit guidelines put in place since the introduction of SOX regulatory changes in 2002. In today’s competitive technical arena adding a talent such as Walter will enable your technical team to improve software quality (measured and quantified). His broad experience can add to your company’s depth as well as better alight your younger talent towards achieving the technical excellence. Walter leads by example and with his excellent communication skills can bridge the gap between business needs and technical specifications. If one is forming a new team or just looking to strengthen an existing team, then Walter is that special one of a kind resource that I would certainly recommend for consideration. He can talk to your architects, work with your developers, and organize your QA team - thus he is the one unique technologist that can be the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; for your organization.&rdquo;</li>

						<p>TO: Whom it may Concern</li>
						<p>
							FROM: Steven Messino (Co-founder of Sun Microsystems)<br>
							Vice President of Sales & Marketing
						</li>
						<p>SUBJECT: Recommendation for Walter O’Brien</li>
						<p>It is very seldom in my career I encounter a person who has such a wide array of natural born talents critical to their success in the Computer Industry. Walter has that unique ability to not only strategically design intensely complex software applications, but the gift of explain the design in such a clear and concise fashion that an audience consisting of Chief Technology Officers and Secretaries would both understand the message at their own level.</li>
						<p>In my 12 years of Sales Management I have never encountered a technical contributor like Walter; who in the event of a corporate downsizing, he would be the last member of the Sales Organization I would terminate. At Uniscape he has single handedly leveraged the entire growth of the Software Product Line. His value to the firm far exceeds any other member of the field organization.</li>
						<p>Walter’s diverse talents make him a critical asset to any organization. I would seriously consider hiring Walter in positions as diverse, Engineering Design & Management, Product Management, Evangelist, System’s Engineer and even as a Technical Sales Account Manager. If you choose to bring Walter into your organization, your mutual success is guaranteed!</li>

						Vice President, Globalization Services
						Uniscape, Inc.</li>
						<p>To Whom It May Concern:</li>
						<p>I have previously held a position at ORACLE for seven years as a localization project manager for ORACLE Applications division. I met Walter while working at ORACLE HP in Redwood Shores, Walter worked on Internal Localization tools for ORACLE Europe based in Dublin, Ireland. He had developed the HYPER project which achieved a 97% saving on a $60 Million PO with the Berlitz corporation. I worked with Walter for 1 week in which time he learned and implemented changes to HYPER so that it would also work with double-byte Asian data to be used in Asia-Pacific region.</li>
						<p>Walter joined Uniscape Inc, a company founded by ex-ORACLE employees and worked on a commercial localization tool system, initially called Utopia and later renamed Global Xchange. I discussed extensively the initial architecture and designs of this system, particularly the localization process flow. Walter defined a generic system designed to deal with Help and Source code together leveraging glossaries from both and perfected methods of generation, classification and sorting to achieve the ultimate balance of quality, consistency and savings through reuse. Walter thought out of the box and as a result created new patentable ideas and functions to achieve these objectives.</li>
						<p>In order to complete this task Walter showed a great depth of knowledge in Word, WordBasic Macro programming, File formats and both help RTF files and HTML formatted help. He coded at unparalleled speed and produced top quality code requiring little QA. When issues changed or new raw data raised a problem, Walter’s bug fix & turnaround time averaged approximately fifteen minutes! Many of the above discussions and whiteboard design talks ran late into the night but Walter never left until the current topic of discussion had been resolved by an algorithmic solution.</li>
						<p>Walter proved to be mature beyond his years, he was polite, easy-going and a joy to work with. His work was always carried out with perfectionism and professionalism. Walter is a highly self-motivated individual who is always enthusiastic and passionate about his work. During the time he was working in Uniscape as a sales engineer, he has constantly received high praise from his peers and customers for his broad range of technical knowledge as well as in depth understanding of our products. As a sales engineer, Walter often has to participate in various meetings with our clients and he has always represented the company in a professional and friendly manger. He is always willing to go the extra mile to help other people. In return, he has earned great respect and appreciation from his colleagues and managers.</li>
						<p>Finally I would strongly recommend Walter for any positions he is applying for. He will be a very valuable asset to any company. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</li>

						<p>GLOVIA INTERNATIONAL - A Joint Venture Between MDIS and Fujitsu
						<p>Walter O'Brien, Professional Reference
						<p>I had the pleasure of working with Walter during my role as Vice President of Development and Technology at GLOVIA International, LLC, during parts of 1998/1999. I brought Walter aboard as Director of Global Release Engineering. In this capacity, he built QA, Technical Documentation and Release Engineering.</li>
						<p>The GLOVIA product at that time was an ERP product for the Make-To-Order/Engineer-To-Order Manufacturing space, with close to 10,000 screens, based on around 4000 database tables, marketed in all the regions: Asia, Europe and the Americas. It had been translated by local offices/distributors with widely varying completeness and quality. </li>
						   There was also no standard or repository for all local efforts. It was Walter's responsibility to coordinate with all of GLOVIA's regional offices and begin the complex process of standardizing all translation and localization efforts. Walter's knowledge of this space is encyclopedic and he was able to accomplish this substantial task well 
						   ahead of my expectations. He also proved extremely savvy working with mentalities ranging from Japan to Germany. He quickly built an organization that was well respected within GLOVIA's organizations worldwide and its affiliates. He hired a very gifted team lead to execute the tasks at hand, while managing his budget to the point.</li>
						<p>Walter has impressed me first with his ability to present, while still at Uniscape. Coupled with his extraordinary knowledge of the complex space of internationalization he was able to work well with customers and partners. He has a good sense of technology and high professional integrity. All these traits, I did not expect in a person of his age.</li>
						<p>I enjoyed very much working with Walter and believe he has much potential left to go. I am disappointed to not having the required internationalization challenges in my current position to bring Walter aboard - the moment that situation changes, I will surely attempt to work with Walter again.</li>

						<p>July 22, 1999</li>
						<p>To Whom This Concerns:</li>
						<p>Walter O’Brien is the Chairman of my company’s Technology Advisory Board. The appointment of Walter to head my advisory board and to provide me with feedback and advice on my company’s strategic positioning is by far the best decision I’ve made this year. Not only has Walter been able to provide very concise, focused, and accurate insights to my company’s strategic and competitive position, he has brought his personal contacts from his wide span of influence to help and assist the company.</li>
						<p>As a specific example, I’ve recently successfully recruited my VP of Sales from a direct contact from Walter. I would not have been able to source this superb candidate in such a short time (3 months from first request to successful recruitment) without Walter’s personal contacts, his preparation of my expectations, and his prescreening of prime candidates. Walter completed this assignment for me with great impact and energy even though the recruitment of Sales VP was not a pre-agreed upon activity of Walter’s technical advisory consultancy agreement.</li>
						<p>I would not hesitate to bring Walter into any technology organization in a high-level management position. It is very seldom that I speak this highly of another individual. Walter will bring success and impact to any organization he chooses to align himself with.</li>

						<p>Walter O’Brien has helped TOIN, a single language vendor in the Japanese localization industry, build its strategic alliance with other localization vendors in the world and hence gave us an international presence in the market place. At the same time, he was also responsible for helping us win certain contracts in this industry.</li>
						<p>The following is a summary of what Walter achieved for us in the last year:</li>
						<p>a) General Strategy Advice on the Market and issues of breaking into a US Market.</li>
						<p>b) Introducing the company, with his personal backing to quote on B2B giants contracts like Cornmerceone.</li>
						<p>c) Providing and executing text engineering contracts for a Fujitsu subsidiary.</li>

						<p>It is my pleasure to write this letter in regards to Mr. Walter O’Brien.. I am the founder of Radio Direct Response (RDR), one of America’s largest direct response marketing companies.. In the last four years, we have created over $5 billion dollars in value for clients like Priceline.com, Lycos, and Disney.</li>

						<p>After an extensive search for a technology advisor, we chose Walter O’Brien. He was chosen due to his ability to relate both on the technical and business aspects of our enterprise. Walter has made his mark previously in the field of Enterprise Software Globalization, which is a key element in the efforts of American high-technology companies to enter and excel in overseas markets. More generally, he is an important figure in the Enterprise Resource Planning field, an astute and exceptionally talented professional whose efforts have already saved us a great deal of time and capital in the development of our company.</li>
						<p>At present Walter is serving as the Chairman of our Technology Board and acting Chief Technology Officer. Walter is helping to oversee the development of our website and is assisting us in presentations to venture capital firms and other professional adjunct subcontractors. As we roll out on an international basis, his advice and counsel to us will be of critical importance.</li>
						<p>Walter assists us on a regular basis to evaluate, translate, and formulate our strategic plans. It is important to for us to integrate our philosophy from the spoken and written word seamlessly into an Internet community that captures the intent and spirit of our mission. Walter has been an immense help in this function.</li>
						<p>Walter is an essential part of our organization and we will support him in any way we can as he transitions into the American socio-economic culture. His contribution to the work of major companies in this country and abroad has been nothing short of remarkable, and we are indeed fortunate to have an individual of his stature at the head of our Technology Board.</li>

						<p>To Whom It May Concern:</li>
						<p>It has been my pleasure, as a senior executive consultant at Uniscape Inc., to have worked with Walter O’Brien. I have had twenty eight years experience in the computer industry in marketing, sales and technical implementation and management. I have managed dozens of salesmen and software analysts. At no time in my career have I seen anyone who had such high measures of talent in both sales and technical areas.</li>
						<p>Walter has specifically contributed to the sales foundation of major corporations such as 3M, 3COM, Intel, Oracle and has been an invaluable resource in his sales support capacity, and technical sales training capabilities.</li>
						<p>His extraordinary technical expertise is world class, and I am hard pressed to think of anyone more creative, and capable than Walter in this area, both as a systems designer, programmer and technical manager. As a high tech consultant, I would say without question that Walter is the most valuable asset of my current client, Uniscape.</li>
						<p>Please contact me by email anytime for more details if you wish.</li>
						<p>Thank you.<br>

						<p>To whom it may concern.</li>
						<p>Walter O’Brien has during the course of his studies at the University of Sussex spent two extended periods of work experience at the company for which I work, ISOCOR, during summer vacations. He has also worked with us both inhouse and remotely to deliver a number of specific software projects. I would like to attest to the extremely high quality of Walter’s work and to his exceptional professional and personal attributes.</li>
						<p>When Walter first worked with us, I was tasked with the setting up of a Localization Department. Walter was of immense assistance in setting up the environment necessary and putting procedures and tools in place. In addition, Walter lent his talents to a number of other projects: one of his most noticeable abilities is that of constantly identifying where he can best help out and showing great initiative and self management in getting the job done.</li>
						<p>When Walter next came to work with us, he provided invaluable help in the co-writing and fine tuning of accounting applications which monitor the usage of our messaging infrastructure. This involved swiftly coming to grips with a number of new tools and technologies. Once again, Walter’s work was hallmarked with a perfectionist approach and the ability to manage his time and prioritise tasks, since other ISOCOR personnel were also making competing claims on his attention.</li>
						<p>On a personal level, Walter is a bright, cheerful and helpful person who would be an asset to any team fortunate enough to attract him as a member. Coupled with his prodigious talent and qualifications in software development I have no hesitation in forecasting that he will go a long way in the software industry.</li>

						<p>To Whom it May Concern</li>
						<p>Dear Sir</li>
						<p>Re: Mr Walter O’ Brien</li>
						<p>Walter worked at Zergo Systems Limited for a period of 9 weeks in Summer 1992. His prime responsibility was to re-organise the company’s address database, using the database package, Paradox. He also organised a software register and set up a “standard” PC environment.</li>
						<p>To do this he had to grasp new computer packages and concepts extremely quickly, with the minimum of supervision. His knowledge of PC packages and DOS/file management undoubtedly helped, and we were also very impressed by his approach to databasing concepts and organisation.</li>
						<p>Walter proved to be a very resourceful, conscientious worker, maintaining a high standard of work throughout the project. His time-keeping was good and he was quite willing to work longer hours whenever required. Moreover, he delivered results, completing the tasks in a very professional manner.</li>
						<p>He has an easy-going personality, which enabled him to quickly fit in with Zergo’s other employees.</li>

						<p>I was personal tutor for Walter O’Brien while he was a student at the University of Sussex. As such I received reports from his academic tutors and met with him each term to discuss progress. Walter consistently gained coursework grades at first class or upper 2.1 level. His tutors record that he is “an enthusiastic student, clearly prepared to work hard”, “very well motivated” and that “all aspects of the problem were tackled carefully and well”.</li>
						<p>My impression of Walter is that he is intelligent, hard working and determined to succeed. He takes a thoroughly professional approach to programming and has a very good understanding of commercial needs and opportunities.</li>

						<p>Dear Dr. Husband</li>
						<p>I am writing on behalf of Walter O’Brien, of Rosshaven, Tingarren, Callan, Co Kilkenny, who is currently applying for a place in your undergraduate programme in Computer Science. I have known Walter in my capacity as the coordinator of the Irish site of the International Computer Problem Solving Contest (ICPSC) run by the University of Wisconsin. The contest is held annually on the last Saturday in April and involves teams from about 20 countries. Walter has competed in the most popular division of the 
							contest (Senior Basic - Under 19) for the past 2 years. He and his 2 team-mates achieved 1st place in the Irish Contest this year. They solved 4 of the 5 problems in two hours including a good attempt at the 5th problem. (Copy of problems enclosed). Only 5 teams out of all countries participating solved 5 problems.</li>
						<p>I have found Walter to be a pleasant, intelligent and mature young man with a great flair for computing. I am sure he is well capable of outstanding performance in your programme.</li>

						<p>My name is James K Hurley, I have a background in Telecommunications and more recently in various electronic and computer related technologies which have evolved in recent times. I am employed by Telecom Eireann.</li>
						<p>Walter O’Brien has expressed an acute interest in securing a place on a Computer Science Course at your University, I recommend that a place be given to him for the following reasons.</li>
						<p>Walter is a mature, intelligent, articulate young man with an avid interest in computers. Over the last four years he has shown a keen interest in a wide area of Computer Science ranging from past and present computer technologies to Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems.</li>
						<p>Initially Walter exhibited his BASIC Programming prowess using an Amstrad 464 machine on which he demonstrated Sound, Graphics, Animation and Machine Code routines. Last year he upgraded to an IBM compatible machine and having mastered MS-DOS in a very short period of time, is now rapidly becoming proficient in both Turbo C and Turbo Pascal.</li>
						<p>I am confident that given the opportunity to further his computer studies at Trinity College, Walter will excel in his chosen field.</li>
						<p>Yours sincerely,<br> 
						James K Hurley.</li>
