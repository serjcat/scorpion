			      	<h4>Bio Summary</h4>
					<p>Graduated with a Bachelors of Science and moved on to work at Xerox Corporation. While at Xerox I was able to research and recommend solutions for display resolution abnormalities caused by system hardware and software configurations as well as develop a system to create printing environments to automatically submit print jobs for validation. The automation system allowed an increase in testing productivity while reducing cost. After Xerox, I continued my professional development at Capital Group. There I was assigned to support a software development application designed to monitor the status and health of software versions in development, QA, and production. This system was built on HP Quality Center and allowed the development and QA teams to communicate effectively while maintaining security and compliance with SAS70 and other regulations. In addition to supporting this system I also upgraded it by implementing approved user suggestions, tightening security, fixing loop holes and bugs, and allowing it to differentiate between SAS70 and Non-SAS70 projects.</p>
